## The Details
kuhlekt1vOS is an experiment in bending the rules of what a “web app” is allowed to be.

Instead of porting traditional CLI tools into clunky browser UI equivalents, I’m building a system where real utilities run behind the scenes—powered by Azure Functions—but feel like native terminal tools inside a browser-based OS.

At its core, kühlEkt1vOS is built on top of [**ProzillaOS**](https://os.prozilla.dev/docs/), a component-driven web desktop framework.

## The Features

- Real terminal apps, not just simulations
- Modular app system (file explorer, text editor, terminal, and more)
- Cloud-backed microservices (Azure Functions handle the heavy lifting)
- Fully responsive and accessible
- Built with TypeScript, Vite, and modern web tech
- Open-source and customizable
  
## The Future

kuhlekt1vOS is always evolving. I’m adding new utilities, refining the UI, and exploring what’s possible when the browser becomes a true workspace.
